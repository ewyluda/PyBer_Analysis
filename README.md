# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to utilize the pandas and matplotlib libraries in python to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (original data given in .csv). Then using pandas and matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


## Results
The analysis shows that Urban city types had the greatest amount in total fares, followed by Suburban and lastly Rural.

## Summary
Business recommendations include focusing on Urban areas where the amount of fares realised far surpasses any other type of city (i.g. suburban, rural)
